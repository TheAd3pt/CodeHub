Project phase B
1. Download the dataset: train.csv. This is the data from kaggle’s “House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques”. A full description of the can be found under “data”.
2. Load the data into python.
3. Split the data into a training (75%) and test set (25%).
4. The metric kaggle uses to evaluate submissions is Root Square Logarithmic Error. We are going to use the same! Write a function in python that accepts two arguments (y_true and y_pred) and calculates the error.
5. Define a simple linear model and train in on the training set. Then evaluate it on the test set using the error function from the previous step. This will be used as a baseline.
6. Perform any exploratory data analysis you see fit.
7. Examine preprocessing the data. Some examples are:
• Imputing
• Cleaning
• Scaling
• Encoding
• Dimensionality reduction
• Feature engineering
Some of them will improve your model’s performance some will make it worse. Some techniques might not help you for this task. Feel free to use any other preprocessing technique you want.
8. Your goal is to produce the best results on the test set! Try to examine several different estimators, while performing hyperparameter tuning for each!
Bonus: If you feel confident about your model you can register in Kaggle, download the competition’s test set and make a submission!
